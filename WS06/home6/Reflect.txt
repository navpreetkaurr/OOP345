1. I needed to deallocate memory in vector because without deallocation, memory will be leak.
2. Yes, there could be another solution having functions which can work same exact like this. For example, those fucntions should have ability to distinguish between vehicles having similar names.
3. List stores elements in non-continous memory whereas vectors storer elements one by one in the memory, so list is more efficient than vectors however, they both are data structures and works like same. So, yes I could have used vectors.
