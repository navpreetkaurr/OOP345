This Workshop was a little harder than the previous ones.
IN the end, I was getting two linker errors and it took two days to me to understand that except of using *this.size() I should use this->size(), means ARROW NOTATION to avoid the linker errors. After trying, I get to know that dot notation does not work with ovverload functions. For overload functions we must use arrow notation. And in this case only arrow notation works.
