Worshops are getting hard every week. This week, we learn to deal containers. I was getting linker error because I was using same functions but in one file I used the const keyword but in another one forget. No doubt, it was a silly mistake, but gave me huge problem. After that I used move and copy assignments in both ConfirmationSender and Restaurant module, which was not the right way to do this workshop. After, I used just these assignment operators in ConfirmationSender and I was successful to implement the files together then.
